Work in progress
SupplyCache.net is an easy to access inventory management system. Users with accounts can manually add items to a list and keep track each time they check stock.
Future plans involve allowing users to generate shopping lists based on item quantity and desired item quantity. Users will also be able to send shopping lists to
themselves or others directly through the SupplyCache.net website. Users will be able to share their lists with other users.
